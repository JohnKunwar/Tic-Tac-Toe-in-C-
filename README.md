# Tic Tac Toe
Terminal base simple tic tac toe game with bot.
The bot is very bad. Only places 'O' at random position. I should probably write a good bot in future :P

# Bot Development progress
Previous bot was random bot. Newly bot is updated bot with whenever it sees a winning move it plays it.

# Issue
Uses srand and rand on file bot.c so for windows modification is needed.
